# Project with Jedha

Imagine working for Uber: <br />
"One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them. [...] Therefore, Uber's data team would like to work on a project where their app would recommend hot-zones in major cities to be in at any given time of day." 
Paris on April 2022. 

## Objective
The objective is to create algorithms that will determine where are the hot-zones that drivers should be in. Therefore:

- Create an algorithm to find hot zones
- Visualize results on a nice dashboard

## Dataset
The dataset was given by Jedha [New York City pickups](https://full-stack-bigdata-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Machine+Learning+non+Supervis%C3%A9/Projects/uber-trip-data.zip).

## Prerequisites

### Build database


### Dependencies
- The source code is written in Python 3.
- The python packages can be installed with pip : `pip3 install -R requirements.txt`

## Usage
### Explore_dataset.ipynb
**Automates some computations of basic statistics and plots for each feature in the dataset**
- Input file : TODO.csv

### Train_models.ipynb
**Trains clustering algorithms (K-means vs DBScan) and compare their performances**
- Input file : TODO.csv
